We successfully developed and validated two practical point systems to predict individual-level influenza vaccine-elicited antibody responses. These systems could facilitate personalized vaccination recommendations, policymaking, and resource allocation in influenza vaccination programs. The proposed point system is also a valuable tool for targeting populations that are likely to benefit most from influenza vaccination.
