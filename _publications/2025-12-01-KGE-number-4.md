Existing kernel methods for spatiotemporal semiparametric models fail to properly account for the dependence structures inherent in the data, resulting in less efficient estimation. The complexity of these structures further poses methodological challenges for both inference and computation. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel profile-type approach for estimating these models. This approach flexibly learns the dependence structure without assuming stationarity by leveraging machine learning techniques. Unlike existing methods, it properly accounts for spatiotemporal dependencies in estimating both the nonparametric and parametric components of the mean function. Under a spatiotemporal increasing-domain asymptotic framework, we show that the proposed estimator reduces bias and improves efficiency relative to existing kernel estimators. It also ensures consistency and achieves optimal efficiency for the parametric component. To our knowledge, this study provides the first large-sample evidence supporting the application of spatiotemporal semiparametric modeling combined with machine learning for irregular spatial data. Simulation studies further demonstrate the proposed method's finite-sample performance and robustness, even when the covariance or data-generating process is misspecified. An analysis of real-world air pollution data further validates that our methodology provides an efficient and scalable framework for inference and prediction in complex spatiotemporal dependent data.
